# Momentum Trading Strategy ðŸ“ˆ

This project simulates a basic **momentum-based trading strategy** using historical stock price data. It focuses on identifying profitable entry and exit signals based on moving average crossovers, while incorporating concepts from **time-series analysis**, **stochastic processes**, and **volatility-based thresholds**.

## Features
- Historical stock data download (using `yfinance`)
- Moving average crossover strategy
- Momentum vs mean-reverting pattern detection
- Backtesting with performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns)
- Parameterized modeling and visualization

## Project Structure
- `project_1_starter.ipynb` â€“ Main Jupyter notebook containing the simulation
- `helper.py` â€“ Helper functions for signal processing
- `project_helper.py` â€“ Utility functions
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies

## Concepts Covered
- Momentum indicators
- Time-series pattern recognition
- Mean-reversion vs momentum logic
- Stochastic process modeling
- Volatility filtering and thresholds
- Backtesting and strategy evaluation

## ðŸ”Œ Dependencies
Install using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
